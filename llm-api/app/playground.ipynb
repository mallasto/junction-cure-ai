Managed to get most of my tasks done, but couldn't shake off this lingering feeling of being overwhelmed, even by small things. Dinner was nice, made spaghetti, my favorite, but it didn't taste as good as it usually does. Feeling pretty tired, although I didn't do much. Going to try and get some sleep, hopefully will feel more energized tomorrow.\n",

I’ve been finding it hard to concentrate lately, my mind keeps drifting off. In the evening, I decided to skip my usual jog. Just wasn't feeling up to it. Ended up watching some TV, but I can't even remember what I watched.\n",

I keep wondering why I can't just be happy when things are going fine. Skipped calling mom; I just didn't have the energy for conversation. Made a simple dinner, but didn’t have much appetite. I should probably try to be more social, but it feels like too much effort.\n",

      "Didn't sleep well last night, kept tossing and turning. As a result, I felt pretty low energy all day. Work was a blur. I know my colleagues are nice, but I sometimes feel so disconnected from them. I forced myself to take a walk during lunch, which was okay. In the evening, I tried reading, but couldn't focus. My thoughts kept wandering to negative things, like past mistakes and worries about the future. I wish I could stop these thoughts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Friday at last, but I don't feel that usual relief. The day was average, nothing particularly good or bad happened. After work, I had plans to meet with a friend, but I canceled. I just didn't feel up to pretending to be cheerful. Spent the night at home, feeling a bit lonely. I keep telling myself I’ll reach out for help, talk to someone about how I’ve been feeling, but I keep putting it off. Maybe next week will be better.\n",
